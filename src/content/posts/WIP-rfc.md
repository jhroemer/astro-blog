I recent went through a RFC process, and it started out horribly..

.. in the end it went really well.
Confusing RFC of both product, technical etc.
Brings me to my first point:

### It doesn't need to be perfect

- You're looking for the productive discussions
- You're looking for feedback
- You're looking for alignment

It turns out, my RFC was extremely effective at provoking all of that, albeit in a more chaotic way than I anticipated.

With that in mind, there's obviously things I would do differently next time.

### Less is more

The more you write, the more there is to nitpick on which will distract the conversation. Make your sections count.

### Scope is your friend

You might be asked a high amount of questions, and sometimes about things which aren't really in scope for the RFC. Save everyone's time by clearly scoping the work at the very beginning of the document.

### Data

Provide data wherever you can. Data is often much easier for discussions, especially if you present it neutrally. Be careful that you're not using data in a way that seems like your pushing your point, and twisting it to your benefit.

### Time

The most important thing you're doing is to come up with a thought-through proposal for something, but it doesn't need to-, nor is it possible to-, be perfect. That's the whole intention with writing an RFC, to widen the circle of people who can help think about a problem.
