- Jojo Mayer quote
- MTB example, drums
- Sara Soudain "just write" - shouldn't be at odds with this
- As so often, do something small and do it well
- Fully ok to write about things other people might find simple. Afraid to blog about 'beginner' topics? Well, fundamentals are good to understand and brush up, for anyone.
