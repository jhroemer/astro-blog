- Scott Tolinsky comment in syntax developer habits show around 39.00 minutes, about not getting stuff out
- Practice in the open
- Jojo Mayer quote "practice as if a master is watching" - what would you want to show, if the master was looking? That you're failing at something that's too hard, or working patiently at your level, the right way?
- MTB example, drums
- Sara Soudain "just write" - shouldn't be at odds with this
- As so often, do something small and do it well
- Fully ok to write about things other people might find simple. Afraid to blog about 'beginner' topics? Well, fundamentals are good to understand and brush up, for anyone.
