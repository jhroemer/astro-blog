# In a non-ideal world

You can find plenty of resources on how to do elaborate setup's, with design systems that will make it possible to get UI coherence and save cost at the same time.
But most likely, you're not gonna be in a place where there isn't enough funds, isn't good enough collaboration between teams, or isn't enough UI products to warrant the pursuit of such a vision. It's probably more likely that you're in a position where some shared logic or system would make a lot of sense, but there isn't a dedicated team, or even dedicated time, for building such a system. Or, while the system could be built, the different teams that might need such a system don't interact much with each other.

# Show don't tell

- Interact (do PR's e.g.) to other team's repo's, to get familiarity with their codebase and them. It's gonna make it much easier to know what's needed, and to make changes later on.

# Someone needs to prioritize it

Doing it on the side is too likely to fail. Unless you don't have much work to do (unlikely), you'll be in a constant dilemma where the shared solution will get down-prioritized. Someone upstairs will have to see the value, and give the green light to prioritize this kind of work along with whatever 'normal' otherwise is going on.

# Design system, micro-frontend, monorepo
