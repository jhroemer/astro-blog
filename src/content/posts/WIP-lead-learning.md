Pick up some resources and get a strategy going, winging-it is not a good idea.

Camille Fournier's 'The managers path' is (not surprisingly) a very common recommendation for the first book to read. Even as an engineer it can be helpful, since it makes it clearer what your manager can help you with and how you can make it work well.

###

Make expectations for the people you manage transparent. Don't know what they are? That's a problem. Sometimes you might, unfortunately, manage someone who's not on the right trajectory. If the expectations are visible you can course-correct, or you can realize that things aren't going to work.

###

Development time? Make sure you understand what the expectations are from your company. Are you realistically going to be able to contribute technically?
Personally I find it hugely important to have technical knowhow.
